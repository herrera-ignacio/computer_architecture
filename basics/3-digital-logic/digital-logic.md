## Logic Gates

The actual physical components or digital circuits, are constructed from
a number of primitive elements called _gates_. Gates implement each of
the basic boolean logic functions.

Formally, a gate is a small, electronic device that computes various functions
of two-valued signals.

> The basic physical component of a computer is the transistor,
> the basic logic element is the gate.

#### Universal Gates

The __NAND__ gate is commonly referred to as a universal gate.

Any electronic circuit can be constructed using only NAND gates.
