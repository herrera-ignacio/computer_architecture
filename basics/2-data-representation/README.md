#### bit (1 or 0)

The most basic unit of information in a digital computer. In the
concrete sense, a bit is nothing more than a state of "on" or "off"
within a computer circuit.

#### byte

In 1964 established a convention of using groups of 8 bits as the
basic unit of addressable computer storage. They called this collection
of 8 bits as byte_.

#### word

Consist of __two or more adjacent bytes__ that are sometimes
addressed and almost always are manipulated collectively.

The __word size__ represents the data size that is handled most
efficiently by a particular architecture.

#### nibbles

8-bit bytes can be divided into 4-bit halves called nibbles/nybbles.
The nibble containing the least-valued binary digit is called low-order nibble.
